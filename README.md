Key Insights

Stable Revenue Growth
Monthly revenue remained consistent (~1.6–1.8M) from 2020–2023, with seasonal peaks indicating promotion-driven demand.

Balanced Category Performance
Home, Clothing, Electronics, and Books contribute nearly equal revenue, reducing dependency on a single product category.

High-Value Customers Matter
A small group of customers generates a disproportionate share of revenue, confirming the importance of retention strategies.

Repeat Customers Drive Value
Returning customers show higher lifetime value compared to one-time buyers.

Average Order Value
The average order value (AOV) is approximately ₹764, providing a baseline for pricing and upsell strategies.

Churn Risk Identified
Several churned customers contributed above-average revenue, highlighting the need for early churn detection.
